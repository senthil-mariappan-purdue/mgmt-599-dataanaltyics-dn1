## Meeting 1: Kick-Off & Project Selection  
The team convened to review all final project options:  
- *Option A:* E-Commerce Acquisition Analysis  
- *Option B:* Retail Chain Transformation  
- *Option C:* Education Investment Strategy  
- *Option D:* Clean Energy Portfolio Optimization  
- *Option E:* Choose Your Own Adventure  

Following discussion, we voted based on **solvable complexity** and unanimously selected **Option A: E-Commerce Acquisition Analysis**.  

We also defined roles to ensure comprehensive coverage of perspectives:  
- **Financial Performance Analyst** – revenue, cost, and profitability  
- **Customer/Market Analyst** – customer segments and behavior patterns  
- **Operational Excellence Analyst** – processes and efficiency metrics  
- **Risk & Strategy Analyst** – competitive threats and scenario planning

## Meeting 2: Data Acquisition & Collaboration Setup  
Each member sourced potential datasets from Kaggle. After collective evaluation, we selected a dataset robust enough to support all assigned roles.  

To ensure alignment, the team:  
- Validated dataset sufficiency using **ChatGPT**  
- Established a **shared drive** for centralized collaboration  
- Agreed to begin with **role-specific analyses** before integration

## Meeting 3: Individual Analyses & Feedback Loop  
Team members presented their **DIVE framework analyses**. Constructive feedback was exchanged, and refinements were made accordingly.  

A gap was identified: **interactive Plotly charts were missing.** To address this, we decided to independently build visualizations and later merge them into a **consolidated Google Colab notebook** for consistency.

## Meeting 4: Synthesis & Presentation Development  
The team integrated all role-based work into a **Team Synthesis report**. This was carefully reviewed for accuracy and completeness.  

We then co-developed a **10-slide PowerPoint deck** showcasing:  
- Revenue, cost, and profit trends  
- Customer insights  
- Operational efficiency patterns  
- Risk and strategic outlook  
- Recommendations for private equity decision-makers  

The deck underwent peer review to ensure clarity, coherence, and storytelling flow.

## Meeting 5: Final Presentation & Recording

All deliverables—including dataset, analyses, synthesis, slides, and recording—were finalized and submitted.
