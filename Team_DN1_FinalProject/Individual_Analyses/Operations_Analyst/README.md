# Operational Analysis Summary: Ecommerce Transactions

## 1. Most Significant Business Patterns

###Profitability by Region
-USA, UK, and France show higher average estimated profits per transaction.
-A 10% increase in transactions from these regions leads to only a 2.98% increase in overall estimated cost, suggesting a favorable cost-to-profit ratio.
### Cost Drivers by Product Category
- Clothing is associated with higher estimated costs.
- A 10% reduction in Clothing transactions could reduce overall costs by 1.26%.
### Shipment Type & Inventory Turnover
- Negligible correlation between inventory turnover and fulfillment time.
- Shipment types show similar mean fulfillment times, indicating limited impact on operational delays.
### Fulfillment Time Outliers
- 155 transactions identified with unusually long fulfillment times.
- These are concentrated in USA, Canada, Brazil, and Direct to Customer â€“ FBA shipment types.

## 2. Root Causes Behind These Patterns

###High-Profit Regions
- Likely due to higher purchase amounts, stronger consumer demand, and premium product categories.
- Operational costs are higher but manageable, especially when offset by profit margins.
### Clothing Category Costs
- Possibly driven by complex logistics, returns, seasonality, or inventory holding costs.
### Long Fulfillment Times
- Shipment type inefficiencies (especially FBA).
- Geographic challenges (e.g., USA, Canada, Brazil).
- Lower fulfillment ratings and strategic risk levels.
